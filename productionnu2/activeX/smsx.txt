Information on smsx.cab, 31-12-2009

smsx.cab is the ActiveX Component file for MeadCo's ScriptX free printing utility.
This component is included as the free license allows free distribution.
Note that this component will only work fully on Internet Explorer.
On other browsers the ActiveX component will not be used, instead it will simply 
call window.print() which will open the print dialogue box.

The component is included by report_object.php when autoPrint is called.
