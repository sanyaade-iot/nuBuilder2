OVERVIEW
--------

This is the installation documentation for the Linux release of
nubuilder-10.11.25, released on November 25, 2010.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

nuBuilder requires the following software to be installed before it can used.

  * Apache
  * PHP (MySQL extension required)
  * MySQL
  * Postfix (optional)

Emailing reports will require the PHP CURL extension to be installed. Emails can
be sent via a local SMTP server such as Postfix, or they can be sent using a
remote SMTP, `sendmail', or PHP's built-in `mail()' function.


INSTALLATION
------------

STEP ONE - INSTALL AND CONFIGURE SERVER SOFTWARE
------------------------------------------------
  
Install and configure Apache, PHP and MySQL, enabling PHP's MySQL extension and
CURL extension if required.

PHP's magic quotes setting needs to be turned off, and the register_globals
setting needs to be turned on.

** NOTE **  Reliance on register_globals being enabled will be removed from an
            upcoming release of nuBuilder.

Optionally install and configure an SMTP server.
  
  
STEP TWO - INSTALL NUBUILDER
----------------------------
  
Extract the contents of the nuBuilder tar gz into your web root, or any
subdirectory in the web root.
  
** NOTE **  An `index.php' file will be extracted during this process which will
            overwrite any existing `index.php' where you extract to. nuBuilder's
            `index.php' is simply for conveniently of logging into the sample
            site. If you install nuBuilder in a subdirectory of the web root,
            you will need to modify `index.php' to redirect correctly.
  
  # tar --strip-components=1 -xvf nubuilder-[VERSION].tar.gz -C [YOUR WEB ROOT]
	
Import the sample site database into MySQL. This will create a database and user
named `sample'.
  
  # mysql -uroot -p[MYSQL ROOT PASSWORD] < [YOUR WEB ROOT]/sample.sql
	
Import the sample debtors site database into MySQL. This will create a database
and user named `sampledebtors'.
  
  # mysql -uroot -p[MYSQL ROOT PASSWORD] < [YOUR WEB ROOT]/sampledebtors.sql

Import the nuvideo site database into MySQL. This will create a database
and user named `nuvideo'.
  
  # mysql -uroot -p[MYSQL ROOT PASSWORD] < [YOUR WEB ROOT]/nuvideo.sql

You should now delete the `sample.sql', `sampledebtors.sql' and `nuvideo.sql' 
scripts from your web root.
  
  
STEP THREE - CONFIGURE NUBUILDER
--------------------------------

nuBuilder has a global configuration file, `config.php' in the `productionnu2'
directory. It supports the following configuration variables:

  $NUGlobeadminPassword         = "secret";
  $NUPHPExecutable              = "/usr/bin/php";
  $NUMailMethod                 = "smtp";
  $NUSMTPHost                   = "127.0.0.1";
  $NUSMTPUsername               = "username";
  $NUSMTPPassword               = "password";


  $NUGlobeadminPassword
  *********************
  
  This is the password for the `globeadmin' user. `globeadmin' is used for
  developing nuBuilder applications. This user has a global password, which is
  configured here, and also a site specific password, which is configured in the
  `config.php' in each site's login directory. Either password can be used for
  logging in to each site.
  
  $NUPHPExecutable
  ****************
  
  When set to the path of your PHP command line interface, it enables a PHP
  syntax check button on the nuBuilder PHP code edit areas.
  
Note: The variables $NUMailMethod, $NUSMTPHost, $NUSMTPUsername, $NUSMTPPassword, $NUSMTPUseSSL, 
and NUSMTPPort are no longer used in nuBuilder. The nuSendEmail() function inside nuBuilder reads these 
settings from the zzsys_setup table. NuBuilder requires you to enter your SMTP Server information in order to send emails.
Eg. in order to have GMail be your SMTP server, you would enter the following in the Email Settings on the Setup Tab of nuBuilder.
    Auth SMTP username:     user@gmail.com
    Auth SMTP password:     myPassword
    Auth SMTP host:         smtp.gmail.com
    Auth SMTP From Address: user@gmail.com
    Auth SMTP From Name:    Company Email
    Auth SMTP port:         465
    Auth SMTP use SSL:      YES
     

Each nuBuilder site also has it's own `config.php'. It supports the following
configuration variables:


  $DBHost                 = "127.0.0.1";
  $DBName                 = "sample";
  $DBUser                 = "sample";
  $DBPassword             = "samplepass";
  $DBGlobeadminPassword   = "sampleglobeadmin";

  
  $DBHost
  *******
  
  The MySQL server which hosts this site's database.
  
  $DBName
  *******
  
  The name of the database which this site uses.
  
  $DBUser
  *******
  
  Any MySQL user which has full permissions on the database specified by
  `$DBName'. By default, nuBuilder will not attempt to access any other
  database.
  
  $DBPassword
  ***********
  
  The password for the MySQL user specified by `$DBUser'.
  
  $DBGlobeadminPassword
  *********************
  
  An optional `globeadmin' password which is specific to this site. Either this
  password or the one specified in the global `config.php' can be used for
  logging in as `globeadmin'.
